  "claim": "The maximum power conversion efficiency for single-junction perovskite solar cells is approximately 31% under standard test conditions.",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "support_level": "strong",
  "rationale": "Theoretical calculations based on the Shockley-Queisser limit and recent experimental advances indicate that perovskite materials can approach efficiencies near 31%. Record devices have achieved over 25% in laboratory settings.",
  "caveats": "Long-term stability and scalability remain challenges. The theoretical limit assumes ideal conditions not always met in practice.",
  "next_experiment": "Develop tandem architectures and improve material stability to push practical efficiencies closer to the theoretical maximum.",

  "claim": "K2-18b shows evidence of water vapor in its atmosphere, suggesting potential habitability but not confirming life.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "support_level": "strong",
  "rationale": "Multiple independent analyses of Hubble Space Telescope data have detected water vapor absorption features in the atmosphere of K2-18b. The planet orbits within the habitable zone of its star, and the atmospheric models are consistent with a significant water component.",
  "caveats": "Detection is limited by the resolution of current instruments; the presence of water vapor does not imply surface oceans or biological activity. The planet's mass and radius suggest a possible thick hydrogen envelope, which may preclude Earth-like conditions.",
  "next_experiment": "Observe K2-18b with the James Webb Space Telescope to obtain higher-resolution spectra and search for additional biosignature gases.",
